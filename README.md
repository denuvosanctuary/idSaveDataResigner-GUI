## Supported platforms
Out of the box, it only supports SaveData files from the Steam PC version.

# ðŸ¤¯ Why was it created :interrobang:
This GUI version was created to make the original command-line tool more accessible to users who prefer a graphical interface for sharing SaveData files between accounts.

# :scream: Is it safe?
The short answer is: **No.** 
> [!CAUTION]
> If you unreasonably edit your SaveData files, you risk corrupting them or getting banned from playing online. In both cases, you will lose your progress.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always create a backup of any files before editing them.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Disable the Steam Cloud before you replace any SaveData files.

You've been warned. Now that you fully understand the possible consequences, you may proceed to the next chapter.
