> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always create a backup of any files before editing them.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Disable any cloud-sync feature (Steam Cloud, GOG Cloud Sync, etc.) before replacing SaveData files.

You've been warned. Now that you understand the possible consequences, you may proceed.

# 📜 How to use this tool

## Installation
1. Download the latest release from the releases page  
2. Place the executable in any folder  
3. Run `resigner.exe`

## Usage

### Main Tab
1. **Select Operation**: Encrypt, Decrypt, or Resign  
2. **Select Input Folder**: Choose the folder containing your SaveData files  
3. **Game Code**: Select the correct game code for your save files  
4. **User IDs**:
   - For **Decrypt/Encrypt**: Enter the original user ID associated with the save (platform-specific)

   *(SteamID is only required for Steam saves. GOG saves do **not** require a SteamID.)*

> [!TIP]
> After logging into [GOG](https://gog.com) you can open this url: `https://gog.com/userData.json` to access your userId or galaxyUserId (whichever is applicable) to be used.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't share your IDs unless you're sure on what you're doing.

### Settings Tab
- **Output Folder**: Set your preferred output directory  
- Processed files are saved with the same input folder name plus a suffix describing the operation
